							<h1>Education Service</h1>
							<p>At LEVISA we specialise in helping people to come to Australia to study.
                            We can help you find the perfect course to study at one of the best high schools, TAFEs or universities in Australia – the one that is right for you.
                            We can organise your student visa and take care of all the paperwork.
                            Let us worry about all the small things so that you can focus on the big things in your life – like learning, experiencing everything Australia has to offer and building your own future.
                            We have helped many students from Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines to come to Australia to realise their study dreams. We can help you too.
                            Let us lead the way – we have expert education counsellors and registered migration agents that can create study plan that is tailored just for you.
                            Everyone is different and we all have our own stories. We want to hear yours so we can help you write the next chapter in Australia.</p><br>
                            <h1>How it works</h1>
                            <b>Step 1: We listen to you and show you the best options</b><p> – our education counsellor will chat with you about your study background, professional interests and career goals. They know all about what’s on offer and will give a list of course options to help you find the one that will set you on the right path.</p>
                            <b>Step 2: Choose your education institution and city</b><p> – we will advise you which TAFE, university or educational institution offers your preferred course and discuss which Australian city you want live and study in. We’ll assess whether you meet the study requirements and let you know about all the costs and benefits involved.</p>
                            <b>Step 3: We check whether you can get a visa</b><p> – our registered migration agent will check whether you meet the eligibility for you to obtain a student visa and what documentation you will need to provide.</p>
                            <b>Step 4: We look after all of the paperwork for you</b><p> – this includes talking to your education institution, organising your letter of offer and arranging your enrolment as well as lodging your visa application. All you need to do is to sit back and wait for your visa outcome.</p>
                            <b>Step 5: We welcome you and make you feel at home</b><p> – Collect Visa Grant Letter and arrive to Australia. We have free mentoring lessons and workshops to help you get settled in Australia and ready to embark on the next chapter of your life.</p>

                        <p>However, student visas are also the number one most refused visa in Australia. Sadly, many students

                                be given the opportunity to study in Australia. We have helped many students to undertake their
                                dream course and embark on their own path towards a successful and rewarding career.</p>

							<h1>Visa Services</h1>
							<p>Moving to Australia is a major life changing decision – you want to make the right choices for you and your family’s future.
							It’s a big deal for you – so it’s a big deal for us.

							Follow the simple steps below and make your dream into reality:</p><br>

							<ol>
							<li><b>Email us and receive a Levisa questionnaire to complete</b> – this let us know more about you and circumstances so we can start giving you advice that is suited just for you.

							<li><b>Book a consultation</b> – We will dedicate time and attention to listen to your individual needs, concerns to make the smart visa choices for you. We then develop tailored migration solutions, clever visa strategy and action plan to maximize your chances of success.</li>
							<li><b>End to end visa handling service</b> – we guide you on the documents you need and assist with related things such as offer letters, skills assessment or state or territory government nominations. We handle all the paperwork and lodge the visa application on your behalf. Our smart and comprehensive inhouse system is designed to ensure nothing gets missed and ticks the boxes of approval. All you have to do afterwards is to relax and wait for the outcome.</li>
							<li><b>Support after your visa is granted</b> – upon successful visa grants, our friendly team will assist you to settle into Australia and ensure you are clear about your rights and visa obligations.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>We speak your language and are fluent in English, Vietnamese and even legal speak 😊</p>

					<h1>Citizenship</h1>
						<p>Becoming an Australian citizen is a wonderful milestone for many migrants who are granted the privilege of contributing to and sharing in this magnificent land down under.
						Apart from being able to officially refer to yourself as an ‘Aussie’ and proudly saying ‘G’day’ to everyone you meet – Australian citizenship also gives you the right to vote in the Federal Election and opens the door to more jobs and travel opportunities.

						We can help determine if you are eligible for citizenship and apply for you. We can arrange interviews, citizenship tests and book your place to attend the citizenship ceremony. Inline with Aussie traditions, you can even shout us a beer at the local pub once it’s all done!

					<h1>Professional Year</h1>
						<p>Let us help you find the right Professional Year program and  Institute for you. Our dedicated team will advise you on the right PY program and secure you a position at one of our leading PY partner providers.
For students studying Accounting, IT or Engineering – completing a Professional Year (PY) give you practical experience that can give you an edge in securing a job and boosting your future career prospects.

A PY can give you extra points needed for skilled migration visas (subclasses 189, 190, 489) and could also help you obtain a positive skills assessment.

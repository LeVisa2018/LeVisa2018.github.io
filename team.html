						<p>Vinh Le is a local Canberran who has a passion in education, law and helping Vietnamese migrants to work towards achieving their future goals.
						Vinh completed a Bachelor of Laws and Commerce from the Australian National University and has over 10 years of experience in providing advice to the Australian Government on a range of policy and legal matters including: competition law, consumer protection, industry codes and infrastructure. He enjoys working closely with stakeholders – which has ranged from engaging with corporate leaders to formulate balanced regulations to helping individuals with enforcing their consumer rights. His passion for law and policy led him to pursue further policy roles at The Commonwealth Department of the Treasury and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and pursue the Migration Law  including work at Legal Aid ACT to assist vulnerable Australians. Vinh has helped many people to achieve their Australian education and migration dreams.
						Vinh started his own migration consultancy business after becoming a Registered Migration Agent (MARN 1801867) offering migration advice to students and migrants then founded LEVISA Pty Ltd to expand on providing educational and visa advisory services to clients around the world.
						Vinh is a local Canberran and strong supporter of the local Vietnamese community. Vinh is fluent in Vietnamese and English</p>

						<h5>Education as a passport to the future</h5><br>
Growing up in Australia as the son of Vietnamese refugees I was used to living on a tight budget. I wore second hand clothes, made my own toys from junk and ate plenty of mysterious canned meat called SPAM.
But no matter now little money we had growing up my parents always invested in my education. My father would always say ‘No’ to toys and games but ‘Yes’ to books, pencils, geometry sets and extra tuition. Like many newly arrived migrants, he knew that a good education was a passport to a successful future.<br><br>
<h5>Australia’s world class universities</h5><br>
Years later when I studied law at the Australian National University it became clear to me why our universities are recognised among the top institutions in the world. Learning in Australia is about challenging yourself to think differently and to find new ways to solve human problems. An education in this country nurtures an inquisitive mind and instills a culture of life learning that serves you in whatever field you may choose. It is little wonder why so many international students choose Australia when it comes to seeking knowledge. <br>
A degree from an Australian university can you give an incredible edge over your peers back at home – qualifications that can make your resume stand out from the crowd. Alternatively it can help you find a job here in Australia, which can open the door the possibility of permanent residence and a new life in the land Down Under.<br>
Of course obtaining an Australian university degree isn’t easy – it’s hard work and even harder for international students. International students must tackle a new field of study in English, endure life away from family and friends, adapt to a new culture and pay expensive student fees.
<br><br>
<h5>Turning a piece of a paper into a future</h5><br>
At university it was always obvious to me which students were the international ones – they would sit at the front of the class frantically taking notes, be the only ones to ask for extra practice problems and be the last ones to leave the library late at night.<br>
International students have a reputation for working harder because often they have a lot more a line. They carry the heavy burden of expectations back at home from parents, siblings and family willing them on to become successful. So as an international student how can you ensure that you are on the right path towards converting a degree into a future?<br>
You need to muster determination and grit but you also need the gather the right information and advice to guide your efforts. For example, you need to know which Australia university is best for you, what courses will maximise your opportunities, what visa pathways are available and what extra steps you can take along the way to ensure you achieve yours aspirations – whether it is a future in Australia or back at home.
At LEVISA we have walked in your shoes – we want to help you to navigate your own path towards realising your full potential.
